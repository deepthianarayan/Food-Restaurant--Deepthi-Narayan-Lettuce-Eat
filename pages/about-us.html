        Re-discover India through an explosion of flavor. Sample small plates or indulge in large ones, from an eclectic selection of ingredients and pairings that infuse the familiar with the unexpected. Satisfy those cravings for good conversation and great food, through an exciting adventure that serves up the very best of India's ingredients and dishes for the armchair traveller. Restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food, and waiters to serve customers at the table.[96] The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.[97][98] These refined "restaurants" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,[98] and some had developed from early Parisian cafés, such as Café Procope, by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.[99] Commercial eateries existed during the Roman period, with evidence of 150 "thermopolia", a form of fast food restaurant, found in Pompeii,[100] and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in China during the Song dynasty.[101] In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining. Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants (fast food), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and vending machines, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.
